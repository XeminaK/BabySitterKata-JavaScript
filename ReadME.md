Hello! Welcome to my solution to the Babysitter Kata Coding Challenge!

For this solution, I have created test cases along with my code.  In order to run the test cases there are a few instructions you need to follow.

1. Download (or clone) my repository.
2. Once my repository is downloaded/cloned, you must open your terminal and run the command "npm install".
3. After you run this command you should have all the required node modules. A "node_modules" folder should appear within the project.
4. In your terminal, run the command "karma start"
5. After you run this command you should be able to see all my test cases and whether they passed or not (They will appear within the terminal).
6. Please note: A Chrome browser will pop up that says "Karma", please leave this up and do not close it until all the test cases are completed and shown within the terminal.
7. To quit karma, run the command "ctrl + c" in the terminal.  This should exit the user out of karma and will close the browser that popped up.
8. To run the test cases again, simply type "karma start" within the terminal again.

Stuck?  Here are some troubleshooting Tips:
1. In order to run the command "npm install" you need to have node.js installed on your computer.  To check if it is installed, open your terminal and run the command "node -v" and "npm -v". 

If a version pops up after the commands: Awesome! You have node.js.
If a version did not display after the commands, you do not have node.js and you will need to download it.

2. If you run "karma start" and the test cases are not displaying, you may need to install karma globally. Just open your terminal and run the command "npm i -g karma-cli"

After karma is globally installed, run "karma start" within the project folder and the test cases should display!
